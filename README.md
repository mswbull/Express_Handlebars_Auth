**Get Started:**

***Authenitcation Pattern:***

1. If the web app is configured to allow unauthenticated access, requests from the browser are allowed without any authentication.
2. If the web app is configured to require authentication, the userâ€™s browser is redirected to the associated Salesforce.com org for authentication.

***Prerequisites:***

Built to run on Heroku with a Force.com Connected App for authentication.

Add the [Heroku Redis] (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis) and [New Relic APM] (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/newrelic) add-ons to your Heroku application. [Papertrail] (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail) is also recommended, but not required.

***Config Variables:***

* AUTH_REQUIRED = true / false
* CF_CALLBACK_URL = https://<heroku_app_name>.herokuapp.com/auth/forcedotcom/callback
* CF_CLIENT_ID = Force.com Connected App ID
* CF_CLIENT_SECRET = Force.com Connected App Secret
* COOKIE_SECRET = Any Value
* LOG_LEVEL = combined
* NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY = New Relic License Key
* NEW_RELIC_LOG = stdout
* REDIS_URL = Redis URL
* SF_AUTHORIZE_URL = https://<org_my_domain>.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize
* SF_TOKEN_URL = https://<org_my_domain>.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token

***Add Your Pages:***

* views = Handlebars Pages (HTML)
* views/layouts = Handlebars Layouts
* views/partials = Handlebars Partials
* public = Unauthenticated Static Assets (CSS, Fonts, JS, IMG)
* private_static = Authenticated Static Assets (CSS, Fonts, JS, IMG)
